       "['The chunk is a description of the anterior wall of the thorax, specifically the sternum, ribs, and their articulations with the thoracic vertebrae and sternum.Anteriorly, the wall is made up of the sternum, which consists of the manubrium of sternum, body of sternum, and xiphoid process. The manubrium of sternum, angled posteriorly on the body of sternum at the manubriosternal joint, forms the sternal angle, which is a major surface landmark used by clinicians in performing physical examinations of the thorax. The anterior (distal) end of each rib is composed of costal cartilage, which contributes to the mobility and elasticity of the wall. All ribs articulate with thoracic vertebrae posteriorly. Most ribs (from rib II to IX) have three articulations with the vertebral column. The head of each rib articulates with the body of its own vertebra and with the body of the vertebra above (Fig. 3.2). As these ribs curve posteriorly, each also articulates with the transverse process of its vertebra. Anteriorly, the costal cartilages of ribs I to VII articulate with the sternum.',\n",
       " 'The provided chunk is a passage describing the anatomy of the thoracic wall, specifically the articulation of the costal cartilages with the sternum and the skeletal framework of the thoracic wall. It is situated within the document discussing various aspects of human anatomy, including the thorax, abdomen, and pelvic regions.Anteriorly, the costal cartilages of ribs I to VII articulate with the sternum. The costal cartilages of ribs VIII to X articulate with the inferior margins of the costal cartilages above them. Ribs XI and XII are called floating ribs because they do not articulate with other ribs, costal cartilages, or the sternum. Their costal cartilages are small, only covering their tips. The skeletal framework of the thoracic wall provides extensive attachment sites for muscles of the neck, abdomen, back, and upper limbs. A number of these muscles attach to ribs and function as accessory respiratory muscles; some of them also stabilize the position of the first and last ribs. Completely surrounded by skeletal elements, the superior thoracic aperture consists of the body of vertebra TI posteriorly, the medial margin of rib I on each side, and the manubrium anteriorly.']"
